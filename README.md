# TideBook

TideBook is a mobile-first, accessible web application designed to provide fishermen and coastal enthusiasts with accurate, easy-to-understand tide information for any location and date. Inspired by traditional tide books, TideBook offers tide charts, high and low tide times, sunrise and sunset data, and essential marine info â€” all accessible via a simple search interface.

This project aims to replace bulky paper tide books with a modern, shareable, and user-friendly online tool, especially designed for users of all tech levels, including experienced fishermen who prefer straightforward and reliable data.
